Introduction
   
SOLID is a set of five design principles that aim to make software systems more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. Each principle focuses on a different aspect of software design and promotes good coding practices. This documentation will provide an overview of each SOLID principle and demonstrate their implementation in Java.

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIBLE (SRP)
   
Definition

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or job.

Benefits

Improved code organization and readability

Easier maintenance and debugging

Better testability and reusability


OPEN-CLOSED PRINCIBLE (OCP)

Definition

The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that existing code should not be modified to accommodate new features but should be easily extended.

Benefits

Allows for easy addition of new features without impacting existing code

Reduces the risk of introducing bugs in the existing codebase

Encourages modular and reusable code


LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIBLE (LSP)

Definition

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Benefits

Enhances code reusability and modularity

Allows for polymorphic behavior and easier maintenance

Prevents unexpected behavior when working with inheritance



INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRICIBLE (ISP)

Definition

The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It promotes creating smaller, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

Benefits
Prevents code bloat and interface pollution
Improves code maintainability and readability
Enables clients to depend only on the interfaces they need


DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIBLE (DIP)

Definition

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. It promotes decoupling and encourages depending on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations.

Benefits

Increases code flexibility and modularity
Enables easier testing and mocking of dependencies
Promotes code reusability and maintainability
