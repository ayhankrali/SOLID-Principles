1. Introduction
2. 
SOLID is a set of five design principles that aim to make software systems more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. Each principle focuses on a different aspect of software design and promotes good coding practices. This documentation will provide an overview of each SOLID principle and demonstrate their implementation in Java.

3. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   
Definition

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or job.

Benefits

Improved code organization and readability

Easier maintenance and debugging

Better testability and reusability

Example

We will explore a simple example where the SRP is applied to separate responsibilities into different classes.

3. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

Definition

The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that existing code should not be modified to accommodate new features but should be easily extended.

Benefits

Allows for easy addition of new features without impacting existing code

Reduces the risk of introducing bugs in the existing codebase

Encourages modular and reusable code

Example

We will provide an example showcasing the implementation of the OCP in Java, where new functionality is added without modifying the existing code.

4. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Definition

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Benefits

Enhances code reusability and modularity

Allows for polymorphic behavior and easier maintenance

Prevents unexpected behavior when working with inheritance

Example

We will demonstrate how to adhere to the LSP in Java, ensuring that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base class.

5. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Definition

The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It promotes creating smaller, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

Benefits
Prevents code bloat and interface pollution
Improves code maintainability and readability
Enables clients to depend only on the interfaces they need
Example
We will provide an example where the ISP is applied to separate large interfaces into smaller, more cohesive ones.
